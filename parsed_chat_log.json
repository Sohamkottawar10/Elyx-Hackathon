The most commonly discussed side effect is muscle soreness (myalgia), though it affects a relatively small percentage of people and is often manageable by adjusting the dose or type of statin. We would start with a very low dose and monitor you closely. The evidence is compelling because multiple large-scale trials show that for every ~40 mg/dL reduction in LDL (and a corresponding drop in ApoB), the risk of a major cardiovascular event is reduced by about 20%. Given your genetics, this is the most powerful lever we have to change your long-term trajectory."
